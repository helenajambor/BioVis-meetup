# Welcome to the BioVis meetup

The **BioVis-meetup** is a new virtual seminar series organised by the BioVis community to complement the BioVis sessions at ISMB (July) and IEEE Vis (October). Why? We wanted to hang out more regularly with the BioVis community. 

We hope this space will grow over time and evolve with input from the worldwide community of all people "BioVis": wet lab researchers, clinicians, bioinformaticians, visualization researchers, designers, data scientsts, all invested in biomedical data visualization.
