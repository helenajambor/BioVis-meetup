# Welcome to the BioVis meetup

The **BioVis-meetup** is a new virtual seminar series organised by the BioVis community to complement the BioVis sessions at ISMB (July) and IEEE Vis (October). Why? We wanted to hang out more regularly with the BioVis community. 

We hope this space will grow over time and evolve with input from the worldwide community of all people "BioVis": wet lab researchers, clinicians, bioinformaticians, visualization researchers, designers, data scientsts, all invested in biomedical data visualization.

- talk title: From bench to news site: Changing the world with data visualization

- short bio (feel free to cut it, if too long ;)):Matthias is a biochemist and bioinformatician. After dismantling mechanisms of multi-resistant bacteria and a dive into the big data secrets of childhood leukemia, he realized: No breakthrough is possible without compelling data visualizations. So in 2020 he founded his data visualization studio higsch, where he specialized on creative, interactive data visualizations. After a year of exciting projects across topics in politics, medicine and human rights, he decided to join the weekly news magazine DER SPIEGEL where he is co-leading their Graphics & Interactive department.
